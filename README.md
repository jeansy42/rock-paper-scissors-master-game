## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor


### What I learned

The development of this project has been very important. In its implementation, I used the CSS preprocessor Sass for the first time, which made me feel very good as it organizes and modularizes the work better. In my opinion, it helped me a lot in acquiring new skills in website design, animations, and interactions among different elements of the site. Once again, I worked with React and further consolidated my skills with it. Honestly, I feel proud of the work.

### Continued development

I intend to continue developing my skills in JavaScript and React through the creation of more complex projects, making my knowledge increasingly useful, and ultimately securing my first job as a programmer.
